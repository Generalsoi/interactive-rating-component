## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React router v6

### What I learned

I learned about proper react routing using v6. I also learned that useNavigate now replaces useHistory in the react router v6.

One of the important things I learned also while working on this project was passing props properly down different child components.

I ran into a bit of a bug, but I eventually fixed it.

### Useful resources

- [React Router v6 documentation](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview) - This helped me while trying to set up react routing for my project.
- [An article explaining react onClick event handling.](https://upmostly.com/tutorials/react-onclick-event-handling-with-examples) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand the react onClick event handling properly while I was working on this project.
